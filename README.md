# 🛡️ Xavier Pena – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I’m Xavier Pena — a cybersecurity learner on a mission to master both sides of the battlefield. My roadmap is structured in phases:

* **Start with Blue Team:** SOC analysis, log correlation, detection engineering, and real-time defense
* **Expand into Red Team:** Attack simulation, exploitation techniques, and adversarial mindset
* **Evolve to Purple Team:** Bridging offensive knowledge with strong defensive practice

I’m currently enrolled in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and following a 12-week roadmap to build practical skills across packet analysis, system monitoring, and threat detection. Everything I do — from Wireshark labs to Sysmon scripting and Splunk dashboards — is tracked in my public GitHub portfolio and shared through weekly blog reflections.

**Focus Areas:**

* Blue Team (Primary): SOC Ops, SIEM, detection rules, IR workflows
* Red Team (Next Phase): Enumeration, evasion, and attack emulation
* Purple Team (End Goal): Defensive security informed by offensive techniques
* Tools: Wireshark, Sysmon, Splunk, TryHackMe, Bash, Python

Let’s detect smarter, attack better, and defend deeper — together.
