I completed my first project in the field of cybersecurity, and honestly, it was more intuitive than I thought. I enjoyed each step of the way and gained a deeper appreciation for how devices communicate.

Along the way, I ran into some hiccups — like trying to dual-boot my MacBook Air and realizing it wasn’t a good fit for my workflow. Then I struggled with virtual machines until I finally got it right. I became very comfortable troubleshooting and installing Linux, both through VMs and on bare-metal.

Really analyzing the TCP packets and individual IPs made me think critically about each process involved in simply surfing the web. It also opened my eyes to the amount of passive data that’s constantly being transmitted across local networks and even between neighboring devices.
